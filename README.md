CS 230 Project @ Stanford: Decoding Images from Multi-Region, High-Resolution, Electrode Recordings In the Mouse Visual System

I train a Feedforward deep neural network to predict the images seen by mice from activity in their visual cortex. 
See "Fritz_CS_230_Project_Final.pdf" for writeup and "project_video.mp4" for more information.
